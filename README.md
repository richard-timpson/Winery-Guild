# Winery-Guild
This was the final project from an 8 week long summer bootcamp at Dixie State University. It is a website built using Node and Express on the backen, and Vue. The entire project was a collaboration with [Reid Poynter](https://github.com/ExtDASH). I built most of the backend services, and he built most of the front-end UI. We never got the website deployed to an actual URL, so unfortunately I don't have a working copy that can be displayed :(. However, I'm currently working on rebuilding the project with a complete re-design, and that should have a live server tha can display the site.
